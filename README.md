# Connectica | Open Source | Discord Integration Made Easy 

Connectica aims to open source a easy way to integrate 3th party apps with Discord via a Discord bot. We offer a hosted bot also called "Connectica" but you can also host your own instance. 

### Hosted Instance "Connectica" 

You can invite our public Discord bot using the following link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1054821342379257957&permissions=8&scope=bot after which you are able to setup your server using the /setup command. You can use /help to get a list of all commands. 

### Open Source Self Hosted Instance 

THis is the best option for users who want ot give the bot a custom name, profile picture and more. You can add features and commit them to this repository. We will occasionally implement new features in this repository to the live Discord bot.
